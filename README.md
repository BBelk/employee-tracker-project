  I couldn't get the manager name to show up correctly when Viewing All Employees so I just went with manager_id instead. Also I completed all of the Bonus Objectives other than being able to Delete departments, roles, and employees.

  ## Description
  This is a Content Management System (CMS) for interfacing with a database through the command-line. With it, users can manage a company consisting of departments, roles, and employees.
 
  ## Usage
  Clone the project, navigate to it and type into your terminal "npm i" to install node. Then type in and press enter after each of the following commands: "npm i inquirer@8.2.4", "npm i console.table", "npm i express", and finally "npm i mysql2". Then you can type in "node server.js" to launch the CMS.
